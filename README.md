# Purpose

The script will parse a PDF and return and return and images as PNG files

## Limitations

- assumes one image per page (fix incoming)
- will not work with secured or encrypted PDF files

## Usage

Run the script and input the file path when required. The output folder will be generated in the same location as the script using the PDF file name as a folder name.

## upcoming changes

- ability to customise output path
- ability to parse more than one image per page
- ability to customise output file name
- ability to customise output file type

## timeline for updates

Whenever I feel like it.
